# Welcome and Overview
Welcome to this tutorial on developing a full-stack application containerized with Docker and deploying on AWS! If you're here, you're probably interested in getting hands-on experience working with Docker and AWS, but may not have any experience with either before. This tutorial will assume some prior experience programming with React and Django, although its not strictly necessary, but none with Docker or AWS. 

Roadmap: 
* Docker installation
* Programming and containerizing a full-stack application with Docker
* Deploying on AWS
