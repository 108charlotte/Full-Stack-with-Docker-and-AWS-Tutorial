# Review and Congrats
## Congrats 🎉
You have just built a full-stack application, containerized it with Docker, and hosted it on an AWS EC2 instance! Now that you have an understanding of these different technologies and how they work together, you can use this knowledge to build your own applications or understand existing applications running on Docker and AWS. 

## Review
You created a full-stack application with: 
- user authentication and permissions
- database management
- three separate Docker containers

And streamlined the containerization process with docker compose. Finally, you successfully created an EC2 instance on AWS and deployed your application on it using docker compose. 


Feel free to go back and reference any part of this tutorial if you need a refresher on a certain concept, and congratulations again on completing it!
